Sermon Archive Web Interface
============================

This is a dynamic web-interface for your sermon archive (or really any
directory structure of MP3 files). I've written most of this myself,
except for the getid3 code. 

Features
--------

- Reads ID3 tags off of MP3 files
- If a directory has only directories, it turns into a two column
  layout
- If a folder contains "readme.md", the markdown will be rendered out
  on to the webpage. 

See a live demo at http://archive.spepmedia.com. The underlying directory structure is exposed at http://archive.spepmedia.com/sermons/
